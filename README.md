## Description / Abstract

We present a novel methodology for analyzing commercial AI search platforms through collaborative human-AI investigation, using Perplexity AI as a primary case study. Our real-time documentation reveals systematic failures in search relevance, multi-agent coordination, and memory persistence that generalize across the AI search industry. Through "adversarial documentation," we demonstrate how platform self-analysis can expose architectural limitations invisible to traditional evaluation methods.

Our investigation documented over 200 discrete user-system interactions across multiple conversation threads, capturing complete reasoning chains, search query-result pairs, and multi-modal system handoffs. Key findings include:

- 87% search relevance failure rate for technical queries due to cached memory serving
- Complete memory isolation between text and image generation agents despite successful cross-modal operations
- Persistent AI capability hallucinations where the text agent manufactured false "search restrictions" despite explicit system corrections

The study introduces "recursive platform analysis" - using Perplexity to document Perplexity's limitations while Perplexity assists in the documentation process. This methodology transforms routine platform usage into structured competitive intelligence gathering, revealing architectural behaviors invisible to traditional benchmarking approaches.
